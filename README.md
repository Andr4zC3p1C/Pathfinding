# Pathfinding

A visual comparison between different pathfinding algorighms programmed in Java. These are Dijkstra, Greedy Best First Search, A* and A* combined with Jump Point Search. 
The algorithms are compared side by side with their execution times displayed. They are all run with the same map and one can also edit the map.
One can also specify how many times will the algorihms be run at once to see a "real life" scenario when mayn entites might need a path(RTS game).
